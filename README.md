# WebVisualizationDashboard

I've created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I've created in a past assignment, OpenWeatherMap API. The purpose of this project is to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator.
I've used data from over 500 cities around the world to do this analysis. For building this site, I've used Matplotlib to plot various charts and used HTML and CSS to create the web pages. I've also utilized the functionality of bootstrap and media queries to make the pages responsive.
